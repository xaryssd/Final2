        <h1>SAÉ11: Raising Awareness About Cybersecurity and IT Hygiene</h1>
        <h2>Objective of the SAÉ</h2>
        <p>
            The objective of this SAÉ was to produce a video as well as a press kit on a randomly assigned topic. Our theme was 
            "DDOS attacks." The constraints required working in pairs and completing the entire project in English. Additionally, 
            we had to finish the ANSSI MOOC course to obtain certification.
        </p>
        <h2>Implementation</h2>
        <p>
            We decided to keep the video private but to publish the press kit.
        </p>
        <p>
            For the video, we imagined a scenario illustrating a DDOS attack through a real-life metaphor: 
            a bakery overwhelmed by simultaneous customers, preventing its normal operation. Animations were used to 
            link this metaphor to actual DDOS attacks. An interview was also included to explain how to protect against 
            this type of attack.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first step was writing the script. We defined a plan and divided tasks to work efficiently. 
            We filmed the video in a friend’s apartment, which was large enough to recreate a bakery. We even 
            bought baguettes to make the scene realistic. Finally, we edited the video and finalized the press kit.
        </p>
